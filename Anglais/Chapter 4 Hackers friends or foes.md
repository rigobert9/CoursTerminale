Can we trust hackers ?
### Video : Film trailer, the 5th estate (2013)
Film about the rise of Wikileaks, site to expose confidential and to blow the whistle, then the downfall of Assange and his Asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy.
Film about two hackers, leaking classified information (images of an attack helicopter, in Irak ?), exposing and whistle-blowing war crimes.
Sorta biopic of Julian Assange (and his Pirate Bay shirt) => now in a prison in Great Britain, waiting to be sent to the USA, where he is accused of high treason and conspiracy (was in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, spent 7 years there, but couldn't step out, stepped out in a poor state and got taken in)
Conflict between him and his partner
He leaked videos of secret videos about the war in Afghanistan, where soldiers shot civilians.The American authorities didn't like that. Not. One. Bit.
WikiLeaks intended to denounce state secrets and wrongdoings. Assange became a scapegoat.
About the title : referring to the 4 estates/powers in the US => the Executive (first estate : government), the Legislative (second estate : congresses and federal congress (house of representatives and senate)), the Judiciary (third estate : courts, federal courts and supreme court), and the Media (fourth estate : mainstream media). The fifth estate is now considered to be the non-mainstream media : social media, the internet, independent writers, and sometimes even more powerful voices. It has become a loud voice of counter-power.
=> The fourth estate can be controlled and are dependent on on the first three estates, leading to distrust. Even if they try to disclose secrets, it comes from a black goat of one of the three first estates

=> Scope of the Unit : Ethical questions, controversial questions, whistleblowing
opaque : confidential, secretive, blurred (for the physical meaning) => use "opacity" ?

### Text : Kevin Mitnick book and short biography
Pentesting a credit card company => goes through the security with a fake card and sets a trojan on a computer (can attack remotely, gets thousand of credit card numbers) (=> enters with sly tricks like tailgating (getting just behind someone to get through a door))
Is that illegal ? => Nope, paid by the company itself to prove the firm isn't secure enough (system not full-proof)
Isn't complicated for him : writes in a didactic and educational style to explain how he proceeds
Served 5 years in Prison for doing this for fun, ended up doing it as a job
Affluent = riche, fortuné
Best-selling author, translated in 20 languages and sold in 50 countries
Was an illegal hacker for thrills

### Picture : Whistleblower Superman, by Clay Benett

Looks confident

To make public
To expose
To reveal
To disclose
To inform
To be baffled as to smth
irrelevant


### Audio : 3 types of hackers (white/grey/black)
White => known and paid => Pentest and blue team
Grey => For fun, not sure (not hired) => without permission and everything comes down to what they wanna do
Black => Malicious intentions, for money, destruction or military (red team) => Splashy headlines => Sometimes get to become white hats
Examples : White hat Gan Kaminsky found a DNS breach and a rootkit in his music CDs
Grey hat russians made an ebook cracker bypassing DRM
Red hat's the best hat

About Assange : The British are keeping him, as they're not sure if he will be sentenced to death.

### Video : Debate on RT TV about Assange
Interview broadcast on the news TV channel Russia Today
Quite random people : a journalist for "Commentary" (?) and a "peace advocate"
=> Goal of the program : Interviewing ordinary citizens
An american defending the state and claiming that Wikileaks causes only harm for little effect
VS a "peace advocate" defending Assange, wanting more of this kind of leaks about American operations abroad
Consides that citizens have theright to know about these operations and the governments's actions and/or wrongdoings
Controverial subject in America

! For an organization, use "it", but use"them" as long as you're talking about its members

### Questions p 118
