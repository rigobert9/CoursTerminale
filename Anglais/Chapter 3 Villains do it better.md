Dividing the hero's journey into 12 steps :
Begins and ends in a normal world, and passes by a supernatural world during the quest
1. Begins with a statu quo : hero is a nobody living in the normal world
2. Call to adventure : unexpected event 
3. Refuse the call
4. Meeting the mentor : Running away from destiny, stumbling upon the mentor, and explains the magical power
5. Crossing the threshold : No going back
6. Tests, allies, enemies : training arcs and new friends
7. Entering the inmost cave : win over fears
8. Supreme ordeal : life-changing or enemy
9. Reward 
10. Find the road back home
11. Resurrection as a new person, because else there's no way back home and they want to get back home
12. Return : all's good that ends good, among his peers, at the same place, but better, but the hero is not quite the same anymore

### Audio : the best British villains
Tom Hiddleston -> Characteristics of the villain : In control, brilliant intelligence and elegance, but need to make it look easy. And good with the bri'ish accent
Mark Strong -> British and the villains : The hero only get as good as the villain, it needs a villain. British culture doesn't revere heroes. British actors are not afraid of playing the villain : they love it.
Sir Ben Kingsley -> The influence of Shakespeare and Characteristics of Shakespearians villains : Layered villains, rich heritage of greatly-written villains from Shakespeares.

to keep a stiff upper lip : garder son calme, rester stoïque

### Audio : The rise of villains
Villains : More authentic, more real and relatable => because of the fear of what you could do with your back against the wall
The hero is seen by adults as an unplayable role, something impossible, only children can want to become like them
Example of Miami Vice : even if before it was impossible to make the audience like the villain like a drug dealer, with a great personality or humor, this tendency totally reversed itself.

### Speeches of villains
Agent Smith : very factual, very "matter-of-fact" and objective => scientific and apathetic, but kinda looks down on humans (?)
The Joker : Pauses, très haché, entre essouflé et fou
