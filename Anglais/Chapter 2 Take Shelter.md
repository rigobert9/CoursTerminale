### Image : Cover of the book "Educated", by Tara Westover
The picture, to refer to the title "educated", represents a pencil, but the *shaven* (taillée) part of the pencil only mimics it. Inside it, we can see the picture of a woman standing on a hill, just in front of a forest, facing cliffs or a canyon, gazing into the horizon.
We can imagine this book will present us the "memoir" (as the second title indicts us) of an "educated" girl thrown into wild nature.
### Corresponding text : "I do not exist", p 50
1. The narrator is a young girl, that lives with her family in the mountains as survivalists without going to school or even existing to the eyes of the state.
2. The family of the young girl lives as survivalists, in wild nature, to the rhythm of seasons. They do not send their children to school or event let the state know they exist, living starkly
3. The "days of abomination" seem to be some kind of disastrous event, more or less esoteric, or told as a story to the little girl. They seem to be a catastrophe that would affect society, but not this family that lives on their own and remotely from all society.
4. The rhythm of nature is important to her because it is the family's representation of the flow of time, and is also very important to get organized living in wild nature.
5. This last sentence refers to how the rhythm of wild nature never really changes nor know great revolutions, only stability and cyclic time : the seasons come one after the other, nothing ever changes, and wild life lives without ever changing.

Her family believed that being in the mountains would allow to escape the "Days of abomination"
 and they would live in an everlasting way. 
 Enigmatic last sentence ? Realized that her family's lifestyle was an illusion/disagreed with that lifestyle and values/wanted to get educated/wanted to testify ?
 Brought up with a Mormon dad, who believed like many other Mormons that the wold would end on y2k.
 ### Grammar point : some, any, no
Some and any : some quantity => some for affirmative and any for negative (/0 + some; not + any)
"No" => absolutely none, with an affirmative verb
Any used in questions => None OR Yes
Some in questions => Influencing for a positive answer
None can also be "no + one" => None *OF* us
